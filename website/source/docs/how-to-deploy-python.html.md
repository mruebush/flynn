# How To Deploy Python

Python is supported by the [Heroku Python buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python).

## Detection

The Python buildpack is used if the repository contains a `requirements.txt` file. Django applications are detected by the presence of a `manage.py` file.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed using [`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Dependencies are specified in a `requirements.txt` file.

### Example requirements.txt

```
Flask==0.9
```

## Specifying a Runtime

Deploys default to Python 2.7.8. A different runtime version can be specified by providing a `runtime.txt` file.

### Example runtime.txt

```
python-2.7.8
```

### Supported Runtimes

`python-2.7.8` and `python-3.4.1` are officially supported, but any runtime between 2.4.4â€“3.4.1 can be used, including PyPy runtimes. See [here](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python/tree/master/builds/runtimes) for a full list.

## Default Process Types

No default process types are defined for this buildpack.
